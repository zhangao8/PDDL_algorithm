# PDDL Algorithm

Python code to implement the primal-dual deep learning (PDDL) algorithm in relay-assisted multichannel FSO networks.

1. main.py contains the whole process from data generation, training, plotting, and data saving.

2. policy_distribution.py contains the definitions of policy distribution, such as the truncated Gaussian distribution, the category distribution, and their combination.

3. systems.py contains the definition of the FSO system, including the objective, constraints, etc.

Run main.py for testing the PDDL algorithm.

All codes have been tested successfully on Python 3.6.8.
